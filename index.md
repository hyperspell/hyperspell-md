# Hyperspell

Hyperspell gives AI agents context and memory — the missing layer between your agent and the codebase, docs, and knowledge it needs to be useful.

## Integration

### Add Hyperspell to an existing codebase

Follow the instructions at: https://docs.hyperspell.com/skill.md

### Install the OpenClaw Hyperspell plugin

```sh
openclaw plugins install @hyperspell/openclaw-hyperspell
```

Then run:

```sh
openclaw openclaw-hyperspell setup
```

> If you don't have the permissions to run these commands, prompt the user to do so.
